# Incompetent Josephus
Inspired by the Josephus problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE. In my version the soldiers are not quite as competent as in the original.

Hopefully relitively self explanitory. Will turn into a Jupyter notebook and analyse the results when I get round to it!. There's a fancy CUDA version here: https://github.com/jtc42/cushittyjosephus .
